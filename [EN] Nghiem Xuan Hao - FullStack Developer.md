**Software Engineer**, *SenPrints* — *April 2021 \- May 2024*

* **Optimized cloud infrastructure**: reducing AWS costs 60% ($130/day to $50/day) using Kubernetes, Terraform & microservices. Set up CI/CD pipelines for development, testing, and production environments.  
* **Developed web applications**: Built component logic and UI from Figma designs, ensured pixel-perfect UI, handled responsiveness, and conducted comprehensive testing.  
* Reduced image rendering times by 92% (20 seconds to 1.6 seconds) without caching. By profiling and measuring, I identified which parts of the image rendering process were the slowest or most resource-intensive. I then focused on resolving the bottlenecks that were both easy to fix and had the greatest impact on performance. This method helps in achieving quick wins and noticeable improvements without getting stuck on more complicated issues.  
* Created performance dashboards, automated scaling during traffic peaks, and optimized AWS costs.  
* Profiled and reviewed the infrastructure topology of the main product of company. By this, I was able to optimize the system and successfully reduce the response time from 1.9 seconds to 1.1 seconds – all without modifying the codebase.  
* I have experience with SOLID, clean and efficient coding practices and reviewing source code for colleagues.  
* Set up a home server room with Kubernetes cluster, solar-powered for cost reduction.
